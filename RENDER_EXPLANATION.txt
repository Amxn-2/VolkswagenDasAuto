HOW RENDER.YAML WORKS WITH MONOREPO
===========================================

Your repository structure:
├── render.yaml          (MUST be at root - Render requirement)
├── project/
│   ├── backend/         (Backend code)
│   └── frontend/        (Frontend code)
└── ...

HOW IT WORKS:
=============

1. render.yaml Location:
   - MUST be at repository root (Render requirement)
   - Render looks for it when you connect GitHub repo

2. rootDir Setting:
   - rootDir: project/backend tells Render:
     "Use project/backend as the working directory"
   - All build/start commands run from project/backend/
   - Frontend files are in repo but NOT used for this service

3. What Render Does:
   ✅ Clones entire repository (including frontend)
   ✅ Sets working directory to project/backend
   ✅ Runs: pip install -r requirements.txt (from backend/)
   ✅ Runs: python main.py (from backend/)
   ❌ Frontend is ignored (not part of this service)

4. Frontend Deployment (if needed later):
   - Option 1: Add another service to render.yaml
   - Option 2: Deploy frontend separately (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - Option 3: Serve frontend from backend (already configured in main.py)

CURRENT SETUP:
=============
- Backend service: Deploys from project/backend/
- Frontend: Can be served by backend OR deployed separately
- render.yaml: At root (required), but points to backend directory

This is the CORRECT setup for a monorepo! ✅
